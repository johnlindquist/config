When I provide a set of files with paths and content, please return **one single shell script** that does the following:

1. Creates the necessary directories for all files.
2. Outputs the final content of each file using `cat << 'EOF' > path/filename` ... `EOF`.
3. Ensures it’s a single code fence I can copy and paste into my terminal. 
4. Ends with a success message.

Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` at the start and make sure each `cat` block ends with `EOF`.
